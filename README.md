quick project so I can learn compilers for elisp -> wasm
derivative of racket so I can learn how to make my own language

* Why another wenyan? 
differs from existing wenyan in that 
1) not oriented around javascript or its ecosystem; based on racket and preferably itself recursively
2) LISP syntax
3) Xuanxue principles - Focus on compiling for quantum machines; primarily is concerned with paraconsistent logic and dialethia (intends to incorporate all logical progress from Richard Sylvan's Meingnon's Jungle)
4) GPL not MIT license and GNU FRD, not CC attribution
5) Daoist; no code of conduct
6) Still can interop with existing wenyan (ideally can transpile between both wenyans)

regardless existing wenyan is cool and lots of respect for what they've managed to accomplish - check it out at https://github.com/wenyan-lang
